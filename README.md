# react-brewery
This project simulates a system that controls the temperature of beers inside containers

### Why React?
* It has a great control of DOM using virtual DOM.
* It's based on functional programming.
* Uses the functions of javascript inside of itself.
* I have a great experience with React.
* It's to build a MVP with react-create-app, and has the PWA config by default.
* I think that it's a good choice for bigger projects.
* It's the most used front-end framework nowadays.
* It's more flexible with libs (Redux, Apollo, Mobx, only React without global control state and etc).

### Highlights of my code
* It's clean and has standard with eslint rules provided by airbnb.
* It has a great quality with eslint, tests, pre-commit and continous integration (circleci).
* It's based on functional programming, so I have better control of the state of my application and I can debug it easily.

### Questions / Assumptions
* How this system works? This system will be based on front-end application that receives mocked data.
* Where the user will see the information? At computer screen.
